  <p>This drawing was made last year although i added sunlight to the face two months later. It is <br>
the first drawing that i completed after I got myfirst drawing tablet. My first tablet was the <br>
huion H420 mini. It is cheap and very effective.The image was drawn in Krita and the green hill <br>
zone background picture was in Amino apps.
