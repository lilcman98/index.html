   <h1>Sonic drawing</h1>
  
  <img src="sonic 1.png" width="450"<br><br>
  
  <p>This drawing was made last year although i added sunlight to the face a year later. It is <br>
the first drawing that i completed after I got my first drawing tablet. My first tablet was the <br>
huion H420 mini. It is cheap and very effective.The image was drawn in Krita and the green hill <br>
zone background picture was in Amino apps.
    
  <h1>Me as a peanuts character</h1>
  
  <img src="me.PNG" width="450"<br><br>
  
  <p>This drawing was made this year and it was made because there was an art challenge in a discord<br>
server. It was made in clip studio paint instead of Krita by the same tablet the huion H420 mini.<br>
    It took me 2 hours to draw the whole thing including the background.
    
  <h1>Space drawing</h1>
  
  <img src="solar drawing.PNG" width="550"<br><br>
  
  <p>This drawing was made in the start of this year. This made because I wanted a new wallpaper. It was <br>
    made With clip studio paint like the peanuts drawing. Like the other two drawing this was drawn with the <br>
    huion H420 mini. It took around 3 hours to make.
