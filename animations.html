  <p>This short animation was made in the time period of 4 hours. That may sound unimpressive considering<br>
    that the "animation" is an animatic. Animatic means that the whole animation can look very choppy because<br>
    of of its lack of animation frames. There was originally sound but for some reason it didnt get added in<br>
    like the rest of the video.
