  <p>Note that i am a beginner and this "website" will probably be really bad.
  
  <p>There will most likely be spelling mistakes.
  
  <p>This is my website about my online drawings. I will<br>
    be showing things like times lapse of the process of making<br> 
    the drawing, pictures of my art and a few seconds of an animation. <br>
    
    <p>This is the section to all my drawings that i could find that are saved <br>
      onto my computer. Most of the drawings are from a year ago and some are fairly recent.
