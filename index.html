  <p>Note that i am a beginner and this "website" will probably be really bad.
  
  <p>There will most likely be spelling mistakes.
  
  <p>This is my website about my online drawings. I will<br>
    be showing things like times lapse of the process of making<br> 
    the drawing, pictures of my art and a few seconds of an animation. <br>
   
  <h1>Pictures</h1>
    
  <p>This is the section to all my drawings that i could find that are saved <br>
      onto my computer. Most of the drawings are from 2020 and some are fairly recent.<br><br>

       <h1>Animations</h1>
       
       <p>This is the section of all the short animations ive made. All of them have been made in<br>
       2021 because drawing was more of my thing in 2020. They were created at april-june of 2021.</p>
